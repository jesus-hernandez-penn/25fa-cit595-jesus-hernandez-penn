Hello to the wonderful person reading this file. My name is Jesus Hernandez and I am honered to be here to learn from such distingushed staff. I'm currently working with AthenaHealth, the national EHR company, and I hope to learn from this course the foundations of computer systems that I work with on a daily basis. My role is responsible for making sure that virtual machines are listening for patient chart data, lab/imaging data, and claim data. This exchange of information happens throughout systems all over the nation - including healthcare systems in my own community and that my wife works with (she works at a local FQHC). By having a deeper understanding of how these systems operate, I can become a better steward for my clients and their patients - ensuring all relevant data is exchanged in a timely and efficient manner. 

Thank you for reading. 


Kind regards,
Jesus Hernandez
