Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read this. My name is Jesus Hernandez, and I’m honored to have the opportunity to learn from such a distinguished team.

I currently work with AthenaHealth, a national electronic health record (EHR) company, where my role involves ensuring that virtual machines reliably handle the exchange of patient chart data, lab and imaging results, and claims information. This data flows between healthcare systems across the country — including those in my own community, where my wife works at a local FQHC.

Through this course, I hope to deepen my understanding of the foundations of computer systems that support this critical work. With that knowledge, I aim to be a better steward for my clients and their patients, helping to ensure that vital health information moves securely, efficiently, and without delay.

Lastly, I have worked with the terminal on a Mac previously, though it has honestly been a while, and have experience in Git. The only elements that are new and took a little more work to configure were Docker and using VIM, both of which are newish to me - I have heard of them and have seen others use them but this is my first time actually using them myself.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Jesus Hernandez
